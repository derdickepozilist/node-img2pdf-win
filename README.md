# node-img2pdf-win

This is an Windows-Tool for converting images (jpg/jpeg/png) to PDF-documents.
It is a "just make me a pdf"-Style tool, so it will react to your needs in an overachievemental matter.

## Getting started

Clone this repo to your PC with "git clone <repo-url>".  
Check, if you have at least Node 18+ installed an ready to run (node --version in terminal).  
Otherwise download it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer

## Installation

1. open the project folder in your explorer and double-click on 01_npm_install.bat
2. create a Shortcut to "landscape.bat" with [right click]->[Make shortcut]
3. double-click on 02_go_to_sendto.bat
4. move the Shortcut there and call it "Make PDF landscape"
5. repeat steps 2-4 the same way with "portrait.bat", naming it "Make PDF portrait"


## Usage

Right-click on a .jpg/.jpeg/.png-file and send it to "Make PDF landscape/portrait".

Your image will be embedded into two landscape/portrait-pdfs with A4 format and rotated in both directions (_r/_l) accordingly.
Works with multiple files at once, too, creating both pdfs for each image you selected separately.
